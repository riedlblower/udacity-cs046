1. Write the code to declare an array of doubles called prices

double[] prices;

2. Complete the statement to create an array of ints called scores that can hold 50 ints

int[] scores = new int[50];

3. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
=> this array can hold 12 elements and 12 is the length of the array.

4. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
=> initial value at index 5 is 0.0

5. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
print out the element at index 9.

System.out.println(temperatures[9]);

6. Write the statement to assign 95 to the first element of an int array scores

scores[0] = 95;

7. Complete the code to initialise an array containing the prime numbers less than 10.

int[] primes = {2,3,5,7};

8. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
=> the indeces range from 0 to 11.

9. You have an int array variable scores  of unknown length.
Complete the code to get the length of the array. You can assume the scores is not null.

int length = scores.length;

10. Write code to assign 98 to the last element of the array "scores". scores is of unknown length.

scores[scores.length-1] = 98;
